✅ Delete Student Section : Delete student records by roll number.   
✅ Data Validations : All inputs are validated to ensure accuracy and integrity.  

🔧 Technologies Used :   
🔹 Frontend : Java Swing for GUI development.   
🔹 Backend : Java for application logic.   
🔹 Database : MySQL for data storage and retrieval.   
🔹 Database Connectivity : JDBC for seamless integration between Java and MySQL.  
🔹 Validation : Java validation techniques for input accuracy.  

📜 Data Validations :   
✅ Roll Number : Ensures the roll number is a unique integer.
